  [33X[0;0YOne  of  the  advantages  of  Faithful Transitive Permutation Representation
  Graph are on Groups generated by involutions, such as C-groups. These graphs
  are very useful in the research of abstract polytopes and hypertopes, mainly
  called as "Schreier coset graphs" or "CPR graphs" in this area. Here we will
  give  a  function that builds this graph given a permutation group generated
  by  involutions,  a group and one of its core-free subgroups or by giving an
  isomorphism  of  the  group  into  the symmetric group acting faithfully and
  transitively  on  its  domain.  To use Graphviz in order to create the image
  file,  you  need to be running GAP on a Linux Environment (Windows Subsystem
  for Linux is supported), with graphviz installed.[133X

  GAP  is  running. If Graphviz is installed, the function will also create an
  image  file  on  the  current  path.  If  neither layout nor the filetype is
  specified, then the default layout is "neato" and the filetype is "svg". The
  layouts  can  be  one  of  the following: ["dot", "neato", "twopi", "circo",
  "fdp",  "sfdp",  "patchwork", "osage"] while the filetypes can be one of the
  following:  ["dot", "xdot", "ps", "pdf", "svg", "svgz", "png", "gif", "jpg",
  "jpeg", "json", "imap", "cmapx"].[133X
