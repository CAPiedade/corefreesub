# GAP Package corefreesub

The CoreFreeSub package is a package to compute faithful transitive permutation representations (FTPRs) of groups. Moreover, this package provides tools to determine the degrees of these FTPRs and lists core-free subgroups. Furthermore, this package allows a graph representation of the permutation representations.

The current version of this package is version 0.3. For more information, please refer to the package manual, in the "doc" folder.


## Dependencies
This package requires GAP version at least 4.11.

## Features
The features of this package include

- function to check whether a subgroup is core-free;
- computing (conjugacy classes of) subgroups which are core-free;
- computing faithful transitive permutation representations (FTPRs) and respective degrees;
- computing minimal FTPRs and respective minimal degree;
- DOT file construction of the FTPRs
- Visualization of the DOT file and TeX file output.

There is a manual in the sub-directory doc written using the GAP package gapdoc which describes the available functions in detail. The pdf, html versions of the manual are also available there.
